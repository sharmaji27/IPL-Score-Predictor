# IPL-Score-Predictor

This is just another simple yet intresting project which can approximately predict an innings score based on the data from 2008-2017 IPL season.  
I tries=d training three models:  
- Linear Regression  
- Lasso  
- Ridge  
and out of these surprisingly Linear regression was giving more realistic results.  
If you liked this project star this repo.  
This project is inspired by a similar project made by Anuj Vyas and tutorial by Krish Naik.  ]
I made some improvisations in his code like I totally removed the result page and showed the results on the same page.  
And also I took venue as a feature while training as I think that it ca really play a major role in predicting score.  
Deployed using Flask.  
Just run app.py and go to localhost to see the results.
